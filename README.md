# To run the game:
 - I ran my game on a linux machine, there were issued with using firefox and chrome.
 - google-chrome must be installed.
 - To run: - open terminal where index.html is located, then type the following command in the terminal
           - "$ google-chrome --disable-web-security --user-data-dir index.html "
           - the reason for this is that chrome does not let you load from local file path, and
             firefox does not support certain functionality.
# What is the game about ?
 - This game is about a mad scientist "Santiago Muttonchop" who was trying to discover the secret to human
   flight, however one day in his lab he discovered a new element. This element was the key
   to his research but something went wrong. The element which he called "flightonium", got
   mixed with the food of his hadida subjects. The flightonium gave the hadidas super intelligence.
   This made them realize what was happening to them and all of the animals of the world so they set
   on a mission to take down the human race. Now it is up to santiago to take them down or it is all over
   the human race.
